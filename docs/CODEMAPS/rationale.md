Commits: `9d2e9eb..df20ceb` (+ uncommitted Pattern 4 work)

### Decisions
- **Pattern 4 renamed `04-redis-pubsub` → `04-nats-redis`**: The pattern was redesigned
  to use NATS JetStream for API→Worker task delivery (at-least-once, same as Pattern 3)
  and Redis Pub/Sub only for the SSE fan-out layer within the API tier. Workers use
  `RedisSink` to publish progress directly to Redis; all API replicas PSubscribe and
  deliver to their local SSE hubs. This gives Redis a single clear responsibility
  (cross-replica SSE routing) while NATS owns work distribution.

- **nginx `resolver 127.0.0.11` + `set $upstream` variable**: Fixes the Pattern 3 bug
  where nginx resolves `api:8080` once at startup and caches one container IP. Using a
  variable forces per-connection DNS resolution via Docker's internal resolver, achieving
  true round-robin across all healthy replicas.
  ```nginx
  resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=5s ipv6=off;
  set $upstream http://api:8080;
  proxy_pass $upstream;
  ```

- **`RedisTaskStore` uses Set + String**: `tasks:all` Set holds IDs for `List()` without
  a full scan; each task is a JSON String with 24 h TTL — mirrors the JetStreamStore KV
  approach from Pattern 3.
